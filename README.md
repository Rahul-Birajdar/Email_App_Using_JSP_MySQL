# Email Subscription and Unsubscription System Using JSP and MySQL

🔍 Project Overview :  
The Email Subscription and Unsubscription System allows users to subscribe or unsubscribe from an email list. It ensures that updates are made both in the MySQL database and via email notifications to provide a comprehensive solution for managing email subscriptions.  

💻 Key Features :  
✅ Subscription : Users can subscribe to the email list by entering their email address. The system updates the MySQL database and sends a confirmation email. If the email is already subscribed, it notifies the user.   
✅ Unsubscription : Users can unsubscribe from the email list by entering their email address. The system updates the MySQL database and sends a confirmation email. If the email is not subscribed, it notifies the user.   
✅ Database Integration : Updates are made in the MySQL database to reflect both subscriptions and unsubscriptions, ensuring accurate and current email lists.   
✅ Validation : Ensures email addresses are in the correct format before processing.   
✅ Feedback : Provides immediate feedback about the success or failure of their subscription request, including status on already subscribed or unsubscribed emails.  

🔧 Technologies Used :  
🔹 Frontend : HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.   
🔹 Backend : JSP for server-side processing and Java for application logic.   
🔹 Database : MySQL for data storage and retrieval, with updates for both subscriptions and unsubscriptions.   
🔹 Database Connectivity : JDBC for seamless integration between Java and MySQL.   
🔹 Email Notification : JavaMail API for sending confirmation emails and updating users about their subscription status.  

📜 How It Works :  
Subscribe : Enter an email address to subscribe. The system validates the email, updates the MySQL database, and sends a confirmation email. If the email is already subscribed, it notifies the user.  
Unsubscribe : Enter an email address to unsubscribe. The system validates the email, updates the MySQL database, and sends a confirmation email. If the email is not subscribed, it notifies the user.
